## Keyboards

This repository is intended to be a comprehensive collection of keyboard types for various devices as triggered by HTML input types.

The test page used to test the keyboards can be found at [levibuzolic.github.io/keyboards](http://levibuzolic.github.io/keyboards/).

If you have a new input type or set of device screenshots to add, please make a [pull request](https://github.com/levibuzolic/keyboards/compare/).
