## Keyboards

This repository is intended to be a comprehensive collection of keyboard types for various devices as triggered by HTML input types.

The test page used to test the keyboards can be found at [http://levibuzolic.github.io/keyboards/](levibuzolic.github.io/keyboards).

If you have a new input type or set of device screenshots to add, please make a [https://github.com/levibuzolic/keyboards/compare/](pull request).
